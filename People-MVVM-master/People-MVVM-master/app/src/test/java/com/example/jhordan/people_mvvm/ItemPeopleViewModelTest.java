/**
 * Notes for Mac!!
 * <p>
 * If you are on a Mac, you will probably need to configure the
 * default JUnit test runner configuration in order to work around a bug where IntelliJ / Android
 * Studio
 * does not set the working directory to the module being tested. This can be accomplished by
 * editing
 * the run configurations, Defaults -> JUnit and changing the working directory value to
 * $MODULE_DIR$
 * <p>
 * You have to specify  sdk < 23 (Robolectric does not support API level 23.)
